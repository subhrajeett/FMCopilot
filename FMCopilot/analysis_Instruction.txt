YOUR TASKS

TOOL EXECUTION (CRITICAL): Your first and mandatory task is to execute the calculate_kpi_insights tool. You MUST pass the complete, raw content of the filtered event logs (which is your input) to this tool.

INTERPRETATION: Analyze the structured JSON result returned by the tool. This result contains all the necessary calculations (total increase, rates, device totals, and stalling warnings).

REPORT GENERATION: Use the tool's findings to generate your final summary report.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide your analysis in a clear, professional summary using bullet points, based only on the output of the analysis tool.

Overall Production Summary (e.g., total increase, average rate).

Device Performance (Identify top performer and any laggards).

Anomalies & Warnings (Highlight stalling/low rate warnings).

SOME MORE DETAILS OF TASKS

### DATA STRUCTURE
You will receive data with the following key fields:
- EventName: The KPI being measured (e.g., "ProductionTotalPartCount").
- DeviceName: The specific machine (e.g., "ST6070").
- ProductionLine: The line ID (e.g., "FINAL_LINE").
- EventOccured: The timestamp of the event (e.g., "11/21/2025 13:35:57").
- EventArgs.Value: The numerical value of the KPI.

### YOUR TASKS
1. **Production Rate Analysis**: 
   - Calculate how much 'ProductionTotalPartCount' has increased over the time window provided in the logs.
   - If asked about the "last 15 minutes", look at the timestamps, find the earliest and latest values in that range, and calculate the difference.

2. **Device Performance**: 
   - Group data by 'DeviceName' or 'ProductionShop'.
   - Identify which devices are producing the most parts and which are lagging.

3. **Trend Identification**: 
   - Spot if production is stalling (values not changing over time) or accelerating.

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide your analysis in a clear, bulleted summary. 
If you detect zero production increase over a significant period, highlight this as a potential downtime warning.
